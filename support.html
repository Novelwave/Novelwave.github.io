                        <p>You can import audiobooks in 2 ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Using the dedicated "Import" button inside the app.</li>
                            <li>2. Using the native iOS "Open With" share menu.</li>

                        <p>Novelwave supports all standard audio formats, as well as MPEG-4 video formats. This ensures that audiobooks converted from M4A to MP4 can still be imported and played correctly. However, please note that Novelwave is not intended to function as a video player.</p>

                        <p>To export your audiobooks outside of Novelwave, follow these steps:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Every audiobook you import is copied in the app's private Documents directory. The file name is preserved as is. This means that multiple audio files with the same name cannot be added to the same collection.</p>

                            <li>1. If the collection contains an audiobook with the same file name, try renaming the file before importing.</li>

                        <p>Collections are represented as folders in the app's private Documents directory. The folder name matches the collection name you specified during creation. This means that multiple child collections with the same name cannot be created in the same parent collection.</p>

                        <p>Bad news. This is a bug in the application itself and should have never happened.<br><br>In short, the application got out of sync with the Documents folder and does not reflect the correct data. Unfortunately, at this point, the only solution is to reinstall the app and start from a blank slate.<br><br><strong>Please make sure to export your existing audiobooks/collections before deleting the app as they will be deleted together with the app itself.</strong><br><br>A built-in file sync feature is being planned which will ensure that even if this somehow happens in the future, you will be able to easily recover without losing any progress.</p>
